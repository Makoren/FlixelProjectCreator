# Flixel Project Creator

A small extension for creating HaxeFlixel projects from a command. It basically invokes [flixel-tools](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-tools) for you. Useful if you find it slow to use the command line tools to create HaxeFlixel projects.

Only tested on macOS. Probably works on Linux, and likely needs extra work to run on Windows.

## Usage

Open a folder (preferably empty) and run the "New HaxeFlixel Project" command.
